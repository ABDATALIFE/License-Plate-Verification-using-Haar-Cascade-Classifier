# License-Plate-Verification-using-Haar-Cascade-Classifier


This project was built for a client on Upwork.

The project uses a Web Camera to detect a License Plate. 
The License plate is detected using a Haar Cascade Classifier.
Once the license plate is detected, OCR is applied to recognize the text within.
